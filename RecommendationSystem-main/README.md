DESCRIPTION OF TASK : This Java program implements a **User-Based Recommendation System** using **Apache Mahout**. It reads user-item rating data from a CSV file (`data.csv`), calculates user similarity using **Euclidean Distance**, and identifies the **nearest 2 neighbors** for each user. Then, it generates **top 3 recommended items** for a given user (default: User 4). The program also prints all users and items in the dataset for debugging.
